# Neural Search Architecture

Processes produces structures, structures produce behaviors, and behaviors are either well adapted or not for the problems they are contextualized in.

this processes to structure to behavior to problem fitness's is the basis of our high dimensional perspective.

We assume the process that is generating the structure is random. We also assume the structure is multi-layered or tiered. Finally, we observe that depending on the context [environment] of the structure, some behaviors are likely to make it easier for said structure to maintain itself. That is, there is a sense of "fitness" to behaviors...iff those behaviors are the function of the context ("what do you want a fish to do? Climb a tree or swim?). So, then we are searching for structures that generate behaviors that yield optimal problem solving strategies within a given context/environment.
